        <h2>Questions for Jan the Janitor</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>"Jan, you were cleaning the kitchen area right before supper went missing—did you notice anything unusual, like trays of food being moved or someone unexpected in the kitchen?"</li>
            <li>"Did you use any cleaning supplies that might have accidentally contaminated the supper, making someone want to get rid of it?"</li>
            <li>"You have access to all the rooms in the building—did you leave the kitchen door unlocked after cleaning, allowing someone to sneak in?"</li>
            <li>"Jan, we found a mop near the kitchen with food stains on it—did you clean up a spill there, and what kind of food was it?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions for Tim the Tech Guy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>"Tim, you were setting up the projector in the dining area—did you notice anything strange near the supper table, like trays disappearing or someone acting nervous?"</li>
            <li>"The security cameras went offline for 15 minutes during the time the supper went missing—did you notice anything unusual with the tech setup that might explain this?"</li>
            <li>"You were on your phone a lot tonight—did you take any photos or videos of the dining area that might show what happened to the supper?"</li>
            <li>"Tim, we found a USB drive near the kitchen with a file labeled ‘Supper Plan’—does it belong to you, and what’s in it?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions for Sally the Snack Lady</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>"Sally, you prepared the supper—did you notice any portions missing, or did you take some to ‘test’ it yourself?"</li>
            <li>"You were in charge of the food—did anyone else have access to the supper, or were you the only one handling it?"</li>
            <li>"There’s a rumor you were upset about the menu choice for tonight—did that make you want to replace the supper with your famous cookies instead?"</li>
            <li>"Sally, your apron has food stains that look fresh—were you handling the supper after it was prepared, or did you spill something while hiding it?"</li>
        </ul>
